# BarbellMath

This is a very simple application to calculate barbell plates. This was hacked in
an afternoon and I have no idea what I am doing with React Native, so please
beware for ugly code ahead.

But, in other news, it works! Select the bar type (10kg or 20kg), press
and hold the plus or minus buttons to configure your weight. If you need
to change the plates, see `components/Weight.js`. Styling is in `BarbellMath.js`.

See it in action:

# How to use:

Pick your bar (20kg or 15kg), press and hold the plus or minus buttons until
you reach your target weight. The longer you hold the buttons, the larger the
increments of weight.

Enjoy!
